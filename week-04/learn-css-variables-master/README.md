## The Challenge

The aim of this challenge is to learn how to use CSS variables to control colour in websites/web apps.

We'll be implementing the default colour palette using CSS variables.

## Getting Started

Clone this repo and open style.css. Your task is to:

- Declare CSS variables that will apply the default light colour palette show in the screengrab above to index.html.

## Stretch Goal

Open index.html and look for the `switchTheme` function inside the `<script></script>` tags. Add logic to the `if` and `else` blocks that will:

1. Select the CSS variables you've defined in the style.css file, and...
2. ...change their values to make a dark mode colour palette!

Try to make sure your text and background colour contrast remain accessible. There are [contrast checking tools](https://contrastchecker.com/) that can help.
