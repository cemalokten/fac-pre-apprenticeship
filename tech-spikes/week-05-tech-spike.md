# ðŸ”® Checking Our Code

## Questions to consider

- [x] What is Prettier? How might it help us write better code?
- [x] How can a linter help us avoid bugs?

#### Prettier
- Make's it possible to automatically maintain consistency 
- External configuration files help establish consistent formatting across a team
- Consistent code saves time esepcially when working in a team

#### ESLint
- ESLint is a linting utility
- Code linting checks static code for patterns or code that do not adhere to certain style guidelines.
- JS is a loosely typed langauge, which is prone to developer error
- ESLint follows 'rules' which if the code does not adhere to throws an error before execution
- Styleguides such as AirBnB are useful for beginners to learn the correct way that production code should be written.
